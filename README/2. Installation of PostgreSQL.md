## PostgreSQL Installation and Setup on Debian

Here are the steps to install PostgreSQL on a Debian-based system and then set up your database for the attendance system.

### 1. Install PostgreSQL üêß

You can install PostgreSQL using the `apt` package manager. This command will install the server, client, and a few useful extensions.

Bash

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

This command also sets up a default database user named `postgres` that has superuser privileges.

### 2. Log in and Create a Database

You'll need to log in as the `postgres` user to create a new database for your project.

Bash

```
# Switch to the postgres user
sudo -i -u postgres

# Log in to the psql interactive terminal
psql

# Create your project database
CREATE DATABASE attendance_db;

# Connect to the new database
\c attendance_db
```

---

### 3. Set a Password for the `postgres` User

By default, the `postgres` user on Debian does not have a password. You should set one for security.

Bash

```
# In the psql terminal
\password postgres
```

You will be prompted to enter a new password. After setting it, you can exit the `psql` terminal by typing `\q`. You can now connect to your database using the password you set.

---

### 4. Update Your Connection String

Finally, update the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file with the password you just set.

Ini, TOML

```
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:SECURE@localhost:5432/attendance_db"
```

Replace `SECURE` with the password you created in step 3. Your application can now securely connect to the database.
